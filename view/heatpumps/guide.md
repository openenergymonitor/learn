# OpenEnergyMonitor Heat Pump Case Studies and Resources

The following case studies and associated resources discuss what we have learnt so far at OpenEnergyMonitor about heat pump design, installation and resulting real-world performance.

## Case study 1: End-terrace, Samsung Gen6 5kW

End-terrace solid stone house in North Wales with a Samsung Gen6 5kW air source heat pump. This case study is available as a youtube video here:

At 6:54 Glyn discusses how he did his heat loss calculation using [HeatLoss.js](https://openenergymonitor.org/heatlossjs) an open source tool that we have developed at OpenEnergyMonitor. 

Glyn covers briefly the importance of designing for low flow temperatures (35-40C) when it is -3C outside (design temperature) and the related radiator upgrades that he made to enable running the system at these lower flow temperatures.

Note that Glyn used a particularly low air-change rate for his calculation of 0.3 ACH based on the result from a blower door test. These are far lower than the values given in MCS/CIBSE guidance for pre-2000 properties which are usually around 1.5 ACH for properties of this age (range 1.0-3.0 ACH).

- 20:35 Conclusion

In the introduction, Glyn addresses the validation of his space heating demand estimate through monitored results, highlighting the discrepancy with EPC estimates that, in his case, doubled the projected space heating demand. 

Glyn discusses the result of his blower door test in more detail at 3:10 which suggests an air change rate as low as 0.3 ACH. The video presents results from the coldest day monitored so far where the average heat input from the heat pump was 3.0 kW. This agrees well with the calculated heat demand of 3.3 kW at -3C obtained using these lower air change rate values.

## Case study 3: Mid-terrace, Mitsubishi Ecodan 5kW

*Note from Trystan: This video is a bit old now and reflects an earlier point in my learning and experience with heat pumps. The heat loss calculated was in hind sight a significant over-estimate as air change rates from the SAP/CIBSE guidance were used. A blower door test done after this video and actual monitored heat loss data suggests that the actual air change rate is closer to 0.4-0.7 ACH. The decision to try a non-thermostatic mixer was definitely going over board and Im now more than happy with the choice of the standard cylinder with large surface area coil rather than alternatives such as a thermal store.*
