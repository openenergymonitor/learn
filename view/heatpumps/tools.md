# Heat pump calculators

Open source tools to help with heat pump design and understanding.

## [HeatLoss.js](https://openenergymonitor.org/heatlossjs)

An open source room by room heat loss calculator based on BS EN 12831:2003. Includes automated internal heat balance & room temperature solver. Save and open projects to your computer locally.

Source code available on github [here](https://github.com/trystanLea/heatlossjs).

## [SAP.js](https://openenergymonitor.org/sapjs)

An open source javascript implementation of the SAP 2012 monthly building energy model. This tool builds on previous work on a similar tool called [MyHomeEnergyPlanner](https://github.com/emoncms/MyHomeEnergyPlanner), which started as a collaboration between OpenEnergyMonitor and CarbonCoop, both share the same core SAP model ([OpenBEM](https://github.com/trystanlea/Openbem)). This tool is just a new user interface that focuses on input flexibility as well as pairing things right down to the basics.

The source code for the following tools are all available on github [here](https://github.com/TrystanLea/tools).

## [Heat exchanger 1](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/HEX1.html)

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a counterflow plate heat exchanger between the heat pump and the radiator system. Fixed flow temperature version.

## [Heat exchanger 2](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/HEX2.html)

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a counterflow plate heat exchanger between the heat pump and the radiator system. Improved fixed heat output version.

## [Low loss header](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/LLH.html)

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a low loss header between the heat pump and the radiator system. Fixed heat output.

## [SCOP calculator](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/SCOP.html)

Calculate heat pump SCOP based on design flow temperature.

## [Dynamic heat pump simulator](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/dynamic_heatpump_v1.html)

Explore continuous vs intermittent heating, temperature set-backs and schedules.

## [Building indoor CO2 simulator](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/co2_sim.html)

Explore effect of building occupancy & air change rate on indoor CO2 concentrations.
