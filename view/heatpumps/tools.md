## [Heat exchanger 1](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/HEX1.html)

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a counterflow plate heat exchanger between the heat pump and the radiator system. Fixed flow temperature version.

## [Heat exchanger 2](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/HEX2.html)

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a counterflow plate heat exchanger between the heat pump and the radiator system. Improved fixed heat output version.

## [Low loss header](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/LLH.html)

Calculate heat output and COP for a system with a low loss header between the heat pump and the radiator system. Fixed heat output.

## [SCOP calculator](https://openenergymonitor.org/tools/SCOP.html)

Calculate heat pump SCOP based on design flow temperature.
